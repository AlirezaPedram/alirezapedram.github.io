Iâ€™m a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, affiliated with the Department of Aerospace Engineering. Starting Fall 2025, I will join the <a href="https://www.ou.edu/cs" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.ou.edu/" target="_blank">University of Oklahoma</a> as a tenure-track Assistant Professor. My research lies at the intersection of autonomy, robotics, and machine learning, with a particular focus on developing AI and ML systems for robotic applications. I am especially interested in data-efficient learning, probabilistic generative models for planning and control, and decision-making under uncertainty in both single-agent and multi-agent systems. A central theme of my work is designing algorithms that enable intelligent agents to reason, learn, and act efficiently with minimal processing, sensing, and communication.


Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">University of Texas at Austin</a>, where my research focused on robotics and autonomous systems. Before that, I was a researcher at the <a href="https://www.is.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a> in Germany. I completed my undergraduate studies at <a href="https://www.sharif.edu/" target="_blank">Sharif University of Technology</a>, where I pursued a double major in Mechanical Engineering and Physics. See my <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/CV_Pedram.pdf' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">CV</a> for more details.
